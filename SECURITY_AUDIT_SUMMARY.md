## Summary of Security Improvements

1. **Authentication Security**: Enhanced JWT handling and added proper authentication middleware
2. **Payment Security**: Secured Stripe integration and webhook handling
3. **Input Validation**: Added robust validation and sanitization functions
4. **Environment Security**: Verified proper handling of environment variables
