## üì¶ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Sign up/login to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Create a new project and import your repository
4. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` - Strong secret key for JWT tokens
   - `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` - Strong secret key for refresh tokens
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Production Stripe secret key
   - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Production Stripe publishable key
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Production Stripe webhook secret
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Production Stripe publishable key
5. Deploy!

### Option 2: Other Platforms (AWS, DigitalOcean, Render, etc.)
1. Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed on your server
2. Clone your repository to the server:
   ```bash
   git clone your-repository-url
   cd supermall
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set environment variables (see `.env` file for required variables)
5. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
6. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## üîß Post-deployment Configuration

### Stripe Webhook Setup
1. Go to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Navigate to Developers > Webhooks
3. Add a new endpoint with the URL:
   ```
   https://your-domain.com/api/payment/webhook
   ```
4. Select the following events:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `payment_intent.canceled`
5. Copy the webhook signing secret and update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your environment variables

### MongoDB Atlas Configuration
1. Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster has network access configured for your deployment platform
2. Update `MONGODB_URI` with your production connection string

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. **HTTPS**: Ensure your deployment platform provides SSL/TLS encryption
3. **CORS**: The application is configured to handle CORS properly
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for API endpoints in production

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Logging**: The application uses Winston for structured logging
2. **Error Tracking**: Consider integrating Sentry or similar error tracking service
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Use platform-specific monitoring tools
4. **Database Backups**: Ensure MongoDB Atlas automated backups are enabled

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Environment Variables Not Set**: 
   - Ensure all required environment variables are configured
   - Check platform-specific documentation for setting environment variables

2. **Database Connection Failed**:
   - Verify MongoDB connection string
   - Check network access rules in MongoDB Atlas

3. **Stripe Integration Issues**:
   - Confirm Stripe keys are correct
   - Verify webhook is configured properly

### Support:
If you encounter issues during deployment:
1. Check application logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure network access is configured properly
4. Check platform-specific documentation for your deployment target

## üéâ Success!
