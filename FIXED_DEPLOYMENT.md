# Fixed Super Mall Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Deployment Ready

Your Super Mall e-commerce application is now ready for deployment! We've completed all necessary steps to ensure the application is production-ready and fixed the deployment issues.

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

1. **Postinstall Script Issue**: Removed problematic postinstall script that was causing build failures
2. **Environment Variable Configuration**: Created clear instructions for setting environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. **API Route Configuration**: Verified all frontend pages correctly use the Render backend URL
4. **Vercel Configuration**: Simplified vercel.json to remove references to non-existent secrets

## üì¶ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Render First

1. Push your backend code to a Git repository
2. Create a new web service on Render
3. Connect your repository
4. Set environment variables in Render dashboard:
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` - Strong secret key for JWT tokens
   - `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` - Strong secret key for refresh tokens
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Production Stripe secret key
   - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Production Stripe publishable key
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Production Stripe webhook secret
5. Deploy and note your Render service URL

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

#### Option A: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

1. Push your frontend code to a Git repository
2. Sign up/login to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Create a new project and import your repository
4. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` = `pk_test_51S0mgIC3epDJYUCX65Pc4krOpWgtN1ulXltemgAo661PmhefeXbs6TBIT5CNORrL39TWEnfHIyupSZdnAg9X4Iak00CNZg0h3I`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = `https://supermall-cevd.onrender.com`
5. Deploy!

For detailed instructions on setting environment variables in the Vercel dashboard, see [VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md](VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md).

#### Option B: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to your Vercel account:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy the project:
   ```bash
   vercel --yes
   ```

4. For subsequent deployments to production:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

You can also use our deployment helper script:
```bash
npm run deploy:vercel:helper
```

## üîß Required Environment Variables

### Vercel Environment Variables (Set in Vercel Dashboard)

You must set these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

| Variable Name | Value | Description |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | `pk_test_51S0mgIC3epDJYUCX65Pc4krOpWgtN1ulXltemgAo661PmhefeXbs6TBIT5CNORrL39TWEnfHIyupSZdnAg9X4Iak00CNZg0h3I` | Stripe publishable key for frontend payments |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `https://supermall-cevd.onrender.com` | URL of your Render backend service |

### Render Environment Variables (Set in Render Dashboard)

These should already be set in your Render deployment:

| Variable Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for JWT token signing |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` | Secret key for refresh token signing |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe secret key for backend operations |
| `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Stripe publishable key (for backend) |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe webhook secret for payment verification |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. "Environment Variable references Secret which does not exist"

**Solution**: This error occurs when vercel.json references non-existent secrets. We've already fixed this by simplifying the vercel.json file.

### 2. "Build failed: postinstall script error"

**Solution**: We've removed the postinstall script from package.json that was causing this issue.

### 3. "API calls not working after deployment"

**Solution**: 
- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set correctly in Vercel environment variables
- Verify that your Render backend is deployed and running
- Check that vercel.json routes are correctly configured

### 4. "No data displayed on frontend pages"

**Solution**:
- Verify that your MongoDB database is populated with data
- Check that `MONGODB_URI` is correctly set in Render environment variables
- Ensure that your Render backend API endpoints are working correctly

## üß™ Verification Steps

1. Run the local verification script:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:vercel:local
   ```

2. Check that all environment variables are correctly set in both Vercel and Render dashboards

3. Verify that your Render backend is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl https://supermall-cevd.onrender.com/api/health
   ```

4. After deployment, test that frontend pages can load data from the backend
