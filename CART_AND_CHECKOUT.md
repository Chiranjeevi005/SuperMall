## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

#### Context API
- `CartContext.tsx` - Manages cart state globally
- Provides functions for cart operations (add, remove, update)

#### Components
- `CartPage.tsx` - Main cart page
- `CartItem.tsx` - Individual cart item component
- `CouponForm.tsx` - Discount coupon input
- `CheckoutPage.tsx` - Multi-step checkout flow
- `CheckoutStep.tsx` - Step indicator in checkout
- `AddressForm.tsx` - Shipping address input
- `ShippingOptions.tsx` - Shipping method selection
- `PaymentMethods.tsx` - Payment method selection
- `OrderReview.tsx` - Order summary and confirmation
- `OrderConfirmationPage.tsx` - Success page after order placement
- `PaymentPage.tsx` - Payment processing page
- `AddToCartButton.tsx` - Add to cart functionality on product pages

#### Pages
- `/cart` - Shopping cart page
- `/checkout` - Multi-step checkout process
- `/payment` - Payment processing
- `/order-confirmation` - Order success page
- `/customer/orders` - Customer order history
- `/customer/orders/[id]` - Detailed order view

### Backend Architecture

#### Models
- `Cart.ts` - User cart data model
- `Order.ts` - Order data model (enhanced with tracking info)

#### API Routes
- `/api/cart` - Cart operations (GET, POST)
- `/api/orders` - Order operations (GET, POST, PUT)
- `/api/payment` - Payment processing (POST, PUT)

#### Services
- `paymentService.ts` - Payment gateway integrations
- `emailService.ts` - Email notifications

### Data Flow

1. **Adding to Cart**
   ```
   User clicks "Add to Cart" 
   â†’ AddToCartButton component 
   â†’ CartContext (updates state) 
   â†’ localStorage persistence 
   â†’ API call to save to database (for logged-in users)
   ```

2. **Checkout Process**
   ```
   User navigates to /checkout
   â†’ AddressForm (collects shipping info)
   â†’ ShippingOptions (selects shipping method)
   â†’ PaymentMethods (selects payment method)
   â†’ OrderReview (confirms order details)
   ```

3. **Payment Processing**
   ```
   User submits payment
   â†’ PaymentPage component
   â†’ /api/payment/confirm API
   â†’ paymentService.processPayment()
   â†’ Order creation via /api/orders
   â†’ Email notification via emailService
   ```

4. **Order Management**
   ```
   Order status update (admin)
   â†’ /api/orders PUT request
   â†’ Order model update
   â†’ Email notification to customer
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**
   - Sensitive payment data is never stored in our database
   - All communications use HTTPS encryption
   - PCI DSS compliance for payment processing

2. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication for API routes
   - Role-based access control

3. **Input Validation**
   - Server-side validation for all user inputs
   - Sanitization of data before database storage

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Features**
   - Wishlist functionality
   - Saved payment methods
   - Subscription/recurring orders
   - Gift wrapping options
   - Multi-currency support

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Progressive web app (PWA) support
   - Enhanced mobile experience
   - Accessibility improvements

3. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Real payment gateway integrations (Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal)
   - SMS notifications
   - Inventory management synchronization
   - Tax calculation engine

## Testing

Unit tests have been implemented for:
- Cart context functionality
- Order model validation

To run tests:
```bash
npm run test
```
